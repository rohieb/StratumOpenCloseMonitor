This directory contains everything you need to start your supybot instance with
StratumMonitor plugin enabled. After changing into this directory, just do:

  $ supybot supybot.conf.example

For extra security, you may want to start the bot as a different user:

	$ sudo -u ircbot supybot supybot.conf.example

To start the bot automatically after your machine has rebooted, you may also add
that line to your crontab. (see crontab(1) for an explanation).
