The Stratum 0 Open/Close Monitor shows whether the Stratum 0 hackerspace in
Braunschweig, Germany is currently opened or closed.

Currently the status can only be set by users on IRC. A plugin for the supybot
IRC bot listens for !open and !close commands, and in this case writes an
.htaccess configuration for the Apache web server, which then redirects queries
of status.png to either open.png or closed.png, according to the hackerspace
status. The supybot plugin also writes machine-readable information in JSON,
XML and RFC822 format which can be used to build other applications to display
the status (like @wansti's StratumsphereStatusWidget for Android)

This repository includes the server part as well as some simple clients in the
respective subdirectories. See there for more information.
