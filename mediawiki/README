This simple extension looks in MediaWiki:Sidebar for the section labeled
"Space-Status", and replaces it with the open/close image.

To install the extension, download StratumOpenCloseSidebar.php to your
MediaWiki extensions folder, and add the following line to your 
LocalSettings.php:

   require_once("$IP/extensions/StratumOpenCloseSidebar.php");
