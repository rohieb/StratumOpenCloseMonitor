This is a plugin for Munin to monitor the Stratum 0 open/close status. It
produces a rectangular graph which is 1 at times when the hackerspace is open,
and 0 when it's closed.

To install this plugin, simply copy the file stratummonitor.munin to your Munin
plugin directory, in most cases /etc/munin/plugins, and restart the Munin node.
(This was the tl;dr version, for a more extensive explanation what to to, refer
to http://munin-monitoring.org/wiki/faq#a3.Nodeplugins)

Dependencies are curl, sed and tr.
